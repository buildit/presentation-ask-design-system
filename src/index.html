        <!-- What have done about this? -->
        <section>
          Evolution:

          Static, full-page design & build

          --> Modular builds + styleguide docs

          --> Template languages (PHP -> Mustache -> React...)

          --> Styleguide websites (aka pattern libraries)

          --> UI libraries

          Also: Key milestones: Separation of concerns, mobile first, progressive enhancement...


          At each step of the way:
            1) Sub-optimal way of doing things
            2) Better way is established
            3) Better way introduces new questions &amp; challenges
            4) GOTO: 1)
