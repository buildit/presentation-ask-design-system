            Static, full-page design + build

            --> Modular builds + styleguide docs

            --> Template languages (PHP -> Mustache -> React...)

            --> Styleguide websites (aka pattern libraries)

            --> UI libraries

            Also: Key milestones: Separation of concerns, mobile first, progressive enhancement...

              3) Better way introduces new questions &amp; challenges
              4) GOTO: 1)
