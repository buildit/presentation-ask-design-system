            <p>Design systems are a hot topic today. They seem to be the magic solution to all our woes.</p>
            <p>But, where did they come from?</p>
            <p>What problems do they <em>actually</em> solve?</p>
            <p>And, crucially, what do they <em>not</em> solve?</p>

            <p>Keep your hand up if you have worked on a design system.</p>

            <p>Does this scenario ring any bells?</p>
            <p>You're the developer on a project and the first time you get see actual visual designs, they've already been reviewed and signed off by the client.</p>
            <p>For the 5 page microsite you're making, you count 4 distinct button designs, 3 modal overlay styles and 7 different font sizes.</p>
            <p>The layout for the "desktop" design demands a different ordering of HTML elements than the corresponding "mobile" design.</p>
            <p>All the placeholder text for headings, user names and product features fits perfectly on one line.</p>
            <p>Oh! And, it <em>must</em> work on IE8.</p>

            <p>Or how about this one?</p>
            <p>The 250 page "brand guidelines" PDF that the marketing department sent you, specifies a special typeface for all headings.</p>
            <p>You ask for a web font version of it.</p>
            <p>You are sent some TTF files.</p>
            <p>You explain that you need the <em>web</em> font versions of it.</p>
            <p>Several emails later you are sent the same TTF files.</p>
            <p>None of the TTF files you got are for the weight specified by the brand guidelines for heading text.</p>

            <p>Drink a shot if this seems familiar:</p>
            <p>You've produced some visual designs and need to share them with the team.</p>
            <p>Access to InVision, ZeroHeight and Zeplin is blocked by the company's network.</p>
            <p>Access to Dropbox, OneDrive and WeTransfer is also blocked.</p>
            <p>You attach your designs to an email and hit send. It bounces back - "maximum attachment size exceeded"</p>
            <p>You try to use a USB stick but discover that IT has diabled removable media on your machine.</p>
            <p>Someone tells you that there's an MS SharePoint site on the intranet you can use.</p>
            <p>You lose the will to live.</p>

            Evolution:

            Static, full-page design + build

            --> Modular builds + styleguide docs

            --> Template languages (PHP -> Mustache -> React...)

            --> Styleguide websites (aka pattern libraries)

            --> UI libraries

            Also: Key milestones: Separation of concerns, mobile first, progressive enhancement...


            At each step of the way:
              1) Sub-optimal way of doing things
              2) Better way is established
              3) Better way introduces new questions &amp; challenges
              4) GOTO: 1)
