              <p>Hi, I'm Marcos ... </p>

              <p>Hi, I'm James and I've been noodling around with the World Wide Web (remember when we still called it that?) for about 20 years now. I took some detours along the way, working on a smartphone operating system and, later, entering the realm of UX. However, I keep finding myself gravitating back towards webby things.</p>

              <p>We both work for the digital transformation agency <a href="http://buildit.wiprodigital.com/">Buildit @ Wipro Digital</a>.</p>

              <p>Today, we're going to talk to you about design systems...</p>

              <p>Does this scenario ring any bells?</p>
              <p>Freya is the front-end developer on a web project. By the time she gets to see actual visual designs, they have already been through numerous iterations and, at long last, signed off by the client.</p>
              <p>Grudgingly, she begins analysing the designs. For the 5 page microsite this project is meant to deliver, she counts 4 distinct button designs, 3 modal overlay styles and 7 different font sizes.</p>
              <p>The layout for the "desktop" design assumes a different ordering of HTML elements than the corresponding "mobile" design.</p>
              <p>All the placeholder texts for headings, user names and product features fit perfectly on one line - how convenient!</p>
              <p>Oh! And, it <em>must</em> work on IE8.</p>

              <p>Drink a shot if this seems familiar:</p>
              <p>Dave the designer has produced some visual mock-ups and needs to share them with the team. His boss, Beth, has repeatedly stressed the importance of sharing his work early and often with the rest of the team.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for him, access to InVision, ZeroHeight and Zeplin is blocked by the company's network.</p>
              <p>Dropbox, OneDrive and WeTransfer are all blocked as well.</p>
              <p>He therefore attaches his design files to an email and hits send. It bounces back - "maximum attachment size exceeded"</p>
              <p>He tries to use a USB stick only to discover that IT has diabled removable media on his machine.</p>
              <p>Someone tells him that there's an MS SharePoint site on the intranet he can use to share files.</p>

            <div style="margin-top: 3em; border-top: 1px solid #ddd; font-size: 0.7em; color: #aaa;">
              <p>What about when you're the business stakeholder?</p>
              <p>The company will be making a very important, flagship product launch. It's timed to hit the Christmas market. The accompanying marketing site therefore <strong>must</strong> go live in November.</p>
              <p>Beth the boss is in charge of getting that site built. By April her UX team has done their research and produced a thoughtful and delightful UI concept. However, it is ambitious in its scope and Beth's Gannt charts tell her there's no way it will all get designed and built by November. Luckily, she has a good handle on what the customers want and she cherrypicks the elements of the UI concept that she really needs and fit her budget.</p>
              <p>It's now August. Visual design was meant to have finished a month ago, but more design iterations than anticipated were needed. Also, that idiot Mark from marketing didn't help with his lengthy brand compliance reviews. The remaining time and budget left for build is now extremely tight. Beth knows this and is really stressing out over it.</p>
              <p>Unsurprisingly, the devs feel the same way and give Beth a hard time. Every sprint planning session feels like a battle. Apparently there are problems in the designs. Those have been signed off though, so there's no way Beth's re-opening that particular can of worms. She soon realises that if she pushes hard enough, the developers eventually give in a build what she wanted. They grumble something about "hacks", but as far as Beth can see it looks great. Probably they're just being divas, or lazy, or both. So annoying!</p>
              <p>A site eventually goes up on staging in October. There was a lot of haggling during the dev phase and Beth had to concede some of the features she really wanted in order to meet her milestones. It doesn't quite live up to her original vision, but it'll have to do.</p>
              <p>The QA team soon come back with all kinds of problems. The homepage takes about 20 seconds to load. The layout and nav on some Android phones is a bit screwy.</p>
              <p>It's November. The site needs to launch <strong>now</strong>, so Beth gives the green light to go live. She tells her devs to work over the weekend and fix the slow homepage on the live site. As for those Android phones - who cares? Everyone's using iPhones, right?</p>
              <p>Within a week, visitor stats to the site have dropped dramatically. A whole sub-reddit has sprung up with parodies of her site. Beth's boss calls her into his office for "a chat".</p>

              <p>We realised some time ago that our websites tend to be made up of recurring elements: Headers, footers, links, buttons, etc.</p>
              <p>On the dev side, ever more sophisticated templating languages have allowed us to write the markup for such elements once and then re-use them many times over. Likewise, techniques and tools to better scale CSS to large and complex projects have arisen.</p>
              <p>Designers have increasingly been complementing their full-page mock-ups with styleguide documents that lay out the styles in a more modular way. Their tooling improved too. Painstakingly hand-crafted PDF documents have given way to modular vector graphics. Sending large files around has been replaced by cloud-based sharing and synchronisation services.</p>
              <p>This modular mindset has gone a long way towards smoothing the traditional handover between the Daves and Freyas of this world.</p>
              <p>It has also helped surface and eliminate unintentional inconsistencies in the design and implementation. That in turn improves usability.</p>
              <p>Businesses' bottom lines have also benefitted, since there's less redundancy in the work. Less stuff to design and build is also less stuff to maintain later on!</p>

              <p>Once again, our methods and tools needed to evolve.</p>
              <p>Methodologies like "Atomic Design" gave us a simple vocabulary and mental model that helped us better organise our libraries of UI components.</p>
              <p>Style guide website generators like Pattern Lab, Fractal and StoryBook arrived on the scene, saving us from manually building and maintaining special websites in order showcase our UI component implementations.</p>
              <p>By automating their production, these tools have made it easy for style guide websites to always be up-to-date.</p>
              <p>Since style guide <em>websites</em> contain the <em>actual</em> UI components rather than static design mock-ups, they let everyone involved easily see how the UI components respond to different browsers, devices or content.</p>
              <p>Our style guides had come alive!</p>
              <p>Instead of just improving handovers, we were blurring the boundaries between the various disciplines. Freya, Dave and even Beth could be consumers of and contributors to the living styleguide.</p>
              <p>We began to wonder whether we could make handovers a thing of the past?</p>

            <div style="margin-top: 3em; border-top: 1px solid #ddd; font-size: 0.7em; color: #aaa;">
              <p>Think about it. It should go without saying that a modern web experience, and thus the UI components it is made out of, must be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Device-agnostic</strong>: They need to work well with arbitrary viewport sizes and input mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessible</strong>: People with all kinds of impairments need to be able to interact with them, potentially with the help of assistive technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Performant</strong>: We know that slow page loads and sluggish UI performance will frustrate users. Every part of our UI therefore needs to be as efficient as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Resilient</strong>: Our UI components may be populated with unpredictable content from a CMS. Will they cope well with long words, lengthy runs of text or unusually proportioned images? They might not run in ideal conditions either. Do they work without JavaScript? Or offline? Or in IE8?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Figuring out how to meet all these criteria has to be a team effort. Dave the designer, Freya the front-end developer and also Ursula from UX will need to put their heads together.</p>
              <p>And yet, a wireframe document or a static visual design can never anticipate or express all the nuances that need to go into the actual implementation. Only code can do that.</p>
              <p>A living style guide can be the means by which developers can demonstrate their work to the other disciplines and get their feedback and input. Changes can be made to the code and previewed almost instantly so the whole team can rapidly iterate the <em>actual</em> UI components until they are done.</p>

              <p>That's why it's so important to remember how we got here. Modular designs and living style guides <em>are</em> better than what went before. They are solutions to their predecessors' problems.</p>
              <p>If you didn't run back to PhotoShop and are instead busy trying to tackle these kinds of challenges, then you have unwittingly begun work on your very own <strong>design system</strong>!</p>

              <p>People struggle to explain design systems succinctly because they are not <em>one</em> thing.</p>
              <p>Depending on your point of view, they might be described the effort to scale up your living style guide to serve an entire organisation.</p>
              <p>From a business person's perspective, they could be considered the means by which an organisation gets more efficient at delivering consistent, high-quality UIs.</p>
              <p>The marketing team might simply think of them as the replacement for their old brand guidelines PDF.</p>
              <p>Maybe they are the never-ending struggle to discover the perfect way to make interactive products. And we are all doomed to persue that holy grail for ever and ever!</p>

              <p>The one thing everyone does agree on is that design systems must encompass code, designs, documentation, tools and people. Furthermore, they are never "done" - in order to continuously deliver value, they must themselves be maintained continuously.</p>
              <p>Perhaps "design <em>eco</em>-system" would have been a more appropriate name!</p>

              <p>But what new challenges do they bring with them?</p>

            A design system isn't a project.
            <br>
            It is a product, serving products.

              <p>Organisations need to think of their design systems as a product. They have no end. They need to continuously adapt, improve and evolve in order to remain useful.</p>
              <p>That in turn leads to the realisation that there needs to be a permanent team, perhaps even a new department, that can tend to and promote the design system. They need to be multi-disciplinary. They need to be funded. And they need to have a plan.</p>
              <p>What began as Freya, David and Beth eliminating frustrations in their work has turned into a monster that will reshape the very organisation they work within!</p>

              <p>Make no mistake. Establishing a design system is <em>hard</em>.</p>
              <p>Really. Fucking. <em>Hard</em>.</p>
              <p>Many organisations that now have effective design systems in place, only pulled them off after <em>years</em> of trying. Frequently they will have gone through several failed attempts before eventually succeeding.</p>

              <p>Sharing the burden of work and the knowledge acquired from many, individual projects <em>should</em> be a no-brainer. But try calculating the dollar value of that. <em>That</em> is incredibly hard. Consequently, it can be a huge challenge to pursuade Billy the bean counter that setting up a design system will deliver a return on investment.</p>
              <p>To all the Beths in the audience: Do <em>you</em> currently measure how much effort is spent across your entire organisation on UI-related work? Can you estimate what might be saved?</p>
              <p>What about Mark from marketing? If you're here Mark, are <em>you</em> able to estimate the monetary value of applying the brand more consistently across products?</p>
              <p>Ursula from UX, can <em>you</em> provide figures for how conversions might increase or user suport costs might drop, if the interface of your various products behaves more consistently?</p>
              <p>Gathering the facts and figures that help justify creating a design system <em>and keeping it alive</em> is something <em>you</em> can all contribute to!</p>

              <p>We've seen a lot of great tools emerge that can help the likes of Freya the front-end dev. Tools that make it easy to generate living style guides, update visual design templates, etc. ...when working with <em>web</em> technologies.</p>
              <p>What about Andy the Android developer though? If you build native apps for non-web platforms, the tooling situation is far less mature. Shouldn't there be native equivalents to Pattern Lab for Android, iOS and Windows? If you're an Andy, this is <em>your</em> chance to get stuck in and build one!</p>
              <p>How about non-visual UIs? Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant are user interfaces. You probably want your services on them to also provide consistent UI behaviour. Perhaps you also want your company's brand to be recognisable via them. Shouldn't your design system encompass that too? Make it the home for earcons, jingles and tone-of-voice guidelines. Sam the sound designer, if you're here, get involved!</p>
              <p>There's something here for everyone. We're all still figuring this whole "design system" thing out...</p>
