            <p>Hi, I'm Marcos ... </p>

            <p>Hi, I'm James and I've been noodling around with the World Wide Web (remember when we still called it that?) for about 20 years now. I took some detours along the way, working on a smartphone operating system and, later, entering the realm of UX. However, I keep finding myself gravitating back towards webby things.</p>

            <p>We both work for the digital transformation agency <a href="http://buildit.wiprodigital.com/">Buildit @ Wipro Digital</a>.</p>

            <p>Today, we're going to talk to you about design systems...</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Design systems are a hot topic today. Those that have heard of them could be forgiven for thinking that they are the magic silver bullet that will solve all the world's problems!</p>
            <p>But, where did they come from?</p>
            <p>What problems are they trying to solve?</p>

          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Does this scenario ring any bells?</p>
            <p>Freya is the front-end developer on a web project. By the time she gets to see actual visual designs, they have already been through numerous iterations and, at long last, signed off by the client.</p>
            <p><em>Groan!</em> <q>Dave the designer and Bertha the boss have exceeded themselves this time</q>, she thinks to herself.</p>
            <p>Grudgingly, she begins analysing the designs. For the 5 page microsite this project is meant to deliver, she counts 4 distinct button designs, 3 modal overlay styles and 7 different font sizes.</p>
            <p>The layout for the "desktop" design assumes a different ordering of HTML elements than the corresponding "mobile" design.</p>
            <p>All the placeholder texts for headings, user names and product features fit perfectly on one line - how convenient!</p>
            <p>Oh! And, it <em>must</em> work on IE8.</p>

            <p>Or how about this one?</p>
            <p>The 250 page "brand guidelines" PDF that the marketing department sent you, specifies a special typeface for all headings.</p>
            <p>You ask for a web font version of it.</p>
            <p>You are sent some TTF files.</p>
            <p>You explain that you need the <em>web</em> font versions of it.</p>
            <p>Several emails later you are sent the same TTF files again.</p>
            <p>By the way, none of the TTF files you got are for the weight specified by the brand guidelines for heading text.</p>

        <!-- Slide 5 : Example of designer pain -->
        <section>
          <h1>Design pain</h1>
          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Drink a shot if this seems familiar:</p>
            <p>Dave the designer has produced some visual mock-ups and needs to share them with the team. His boss, Bertha, has repeatedly stressed the importance of sharing his work early and often with the rest of the team.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for him, access to InVision, ZeroHeight and Zeplin is blocked by the company's network.</p>
            <p>Dropbox, OneDrive and WeTransfer are all blocked as well.</p>
            <p>He therefore attaches his design files to an email and hits send. It bounces back - "maximum attachment size exceeded"</p>
            <p>He tries to use a USB stick only to discover that IT has diabled removable media on his machine.</p>
            <p>Someone tells him that there's an MS SharePoint site on the intranet he can use to share files.</p>
            <p>He loses the will to live.</p>

        <!-- Slide 6 : Example of manager pain -->
        <section>
          <h1>Biz pain</h1>
          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>What about when you're the business stakeholder?</p>
            <p>All Bertha the boss really wanted, was to add some marketing blurb about the new product to the company's website.</p>
            <p><q>Should be a quick job</q>, she thought to herself...</p>
            <p>Next thing she knows, the UX folk are refusing to make any wireframes until they have completed a 2 week research phase. A research phase that will involve usability tests using eye tracking on at least 20 participants.</p>
            <p>Dave the designer then tells her that one does not simply "replace some photos and text" on the site. Besides, the current site design is based the <em>old</em> guidelines. The marketing department recently decreed that all new projects <strong>must</strong> use the <em>new</em> ones, so he'll pretty much need to redesign the whole website.</p>
            <p>Finally, Freya the developer is getting antsy because there's an imminent rebuild of the site and its CMS due to begin in the next sprint. Building a new front-end design on the <em>legacy</em> code isn't something her team feels they should be doing at this point.</p>
            <p>Bertha gives up and hires an external agency to build a separate microsite for the product launch.</p>

            <p>Some of these stories will surely seem familiar.</p>
            <p>Whether its hangovers caused by handovers, draconian IT policies or disparate teams losing sight of the big picture - everyone involved has their pain points.</p>
            <p>There are of course plenty more examples. Ever tried to find the <em>web</em>-font files for the corporate typeface? Have you attempted to style the <code>&lt;select></code> element? You get the idea.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, the web community has been busy addressing these kinds of pains over the years. Let's see what they've been up to...</p>

        <!-- Slide 8 : Modular mindset and styleguide docs -->
        <section>
          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We realised some time ago that our websites tend to be made up of recurring elements: Headers, footers, links, buttons, etc.</p>
            <p>On the dev side, ever more sophisticated templating languages have allowed us to write the markup for such elements once and then re-use them many times over. Likewise, techniques and tools to better scale CSS to large and complex projects have arisen.</p>
            <p>Designers have increasingly been complementing their full-page mock-ups with styleguide documents that lay out the styles in a more modular way. Their tooling improved too. Painstakingly hand-crafted PDF documents have given way to modular vector graphics. Sending large files around has been replaced by cloud-based sharing and synchronisation services.</p>
            <p>This modular mindset has gone a long way towards smoothing the traditional handover between the Daves and Freyas of this world.</p>
            <p>It has also helped surface and eliminate unintentional inconsistencies in the design and implementation. That in turn improves usability.</p>
            <p>Businesses' bottom lines have also benefitted, since there's less redundancy in the work. Less stuff to design and build is also less stuff to maintain later on!</p>

        <!-- Slide 9 : Challenges due to modularity -->

          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Fantastic! Everybody's happy now... <em>right?</em></p>
            <p>Well, yes. <em>But</em>, this modular mindset introduced a new set of challenges:</p>
            <p>How should we organise and name our UI components?</p>
            <p>How far should we break down our UI components?</p>
            <p>As we implement the UI components in code, can we showcase them individually?</p>
          </aside>
        </section>


        <!-- Slide 10 : Rise of the living style guides -->
        <section>
          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Once again, our methods and tools needed to evolve.</p>
            <p>Methodologies like "Atomic Design" gave us a simple vocabulary and mental model that helped us better organise our libraries of UI components.</p>
            <p>Style guide website generators like Pattern Lab, Fractal and StoryBook arrived on the scene, saving us from manually building and maintaining special websites in order showcase our UI component implementations.</p>
            <p>By automating their production, these tools have made it easy for style guide websites to always be up-to-date.</p>
            <p>Since style guide <em>websites</em> contain the <em>actual</em> UI components rather than static design mock-ups, they let everyone involved easily see how the UI components respond to different browsers, devices or content.</p>
            <p>Our style guides had come alive!</p>
            <p>Instead of just improving handovers, we were blurring the boundaries between the various disciplines. Freya, Dave and even Bertha could be consumers of and contributors to the living styleguide.</p>
            <p>We began to wonder whether we could make handovers a thing of the past?</p>
          </aside>
        </section>


        <!-- Slide 11 : Living style guides continued -->
        <section>
          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Think about it. It should go without saying that a modern web experience, and thus the UI components it is made out of, must be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Device-agnostic</strong>: They need to work well with arbitrary viewport sizes and input mechanisms.</li>
              <li><strong>Accessible</strong>: People with all kinds of impairments need to be able to interact with them, potentially with the help of assistive technologies.</li>
              <li><strong>Performant</strong>: We know that slow page loads and sluggish UI performance will frustrate users. Every part of our UI therefore needs to be as efficient as possible.</li>
              <li><strong>Resilient</strong>: Our UI components may be populated with unpredictable content from a CMS. Will they cope well with long words, lengthy runs of text or unusually proportioned images? They might not run in ideal conditions either. Do they work without JavaScript? Or offline? Or in IE8?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Figuring out how to meet all these criteria has to be a team effort. Dave the designer, Freya the front-end developer and also Ursula from UX will need to put their heads together.</p>
            <p>And yet, a wireframe document or a static visual design can never anticipate or express all the nuances that need to go into the actual implementation. Only code can do that.</p>
            <p>A living style guide can be the means by which developers can demonstrate their work to the other disciplines and get their feedback and input. Changes can be made to the code and previewed almost instantly so the whole team can rapidly iterate the <em>actual</em> UI components until they are done.</p>

        <!-- Slide 12 : Living style guide challenges -->
        <section>
          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Unsurprisingly, crafting well organised, beautiful, living styleguides is rapidly becoming the de-facto way we approach much of our UI work.</p>
            <p>However, our journey does not end there!</p>
            <p>Once you have a living styleguide, a whole slew of new questions inevitably arise...</p>
            <p>How do we share code between our living style guide and our acutal website?</p>
            <p>How do we continually keep design artefacts, living style guides and the website built from them up-to-date and in sync?</p>
            <p>What happens when we need to support more than a single website?</p>
            <p>How do we cope with multiple CMSes and front-end frameworks?</p>

        <!-- Slide 13 : Enter the design system -->
        <section>
          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>With so many questions and challenges, you could be forgiven for throwing your hands up in despair and running back to PhotoShop's bosom.</p>
            <p>That's why it's so important to remember how we got here. Modular designs and living style guides <em>are</em> better than what went before. They are solutions to their predecessors' problems.</p>
            <p>If you didn't run back to PhotoShop and are instead busy trying to tackle these kinds of challenges, then you have unwittingly begun work on your very own <strong>design system</strong>!</p>

        <!-- Slide 14: Design systems continued -->

          <!-- Visible slide content goes here -->
          (Morpheus picture: Unfortunately, no one can be told what a design system is... You have to see it for yourself.)

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>People struggle to explain design systems succinctly because they are not <em>one</em> thing.</p>
            <p>Depending on your point of view, they might be described the effort to scale up your living style guide to serve an entire organisation.</p>
            <p>From a business person's perspective, they could be considered the means by which an organisation gets more efficient at delivering consistent, high-quality UIs.</p>
            <p>The marketing team might simply think of them as the replacement for their old brand guidelines PDF.</p>
            <p>Maybe they are the never-ending struggle to discover the perfect way to make interactive products. And we are all doomed to persue that holy grail for ever and ever!</p>

            <p>The one thing everyone does agree on is that design systems must encompass code, designs, documentation, tools and people. Furthermore, they are never "done" - in order to continuously deliver value, they must themselves be maintained continuously.</p>
            <p>Perhaps "design <em>eco</em>-system" would have been a more appropriate name!</p>

            <p>But what new challenges do they bring with them?</p>

            A design system isn't a project.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Organisations need to think of their design systems as a product. They have no end. They need to continuously adapt, improve and evolve in order to remain useful.</p>
            <p>That in turn leads to the realisation that there needs to be a permanent team, perhaps even a new department, that can tend to and promote the design system. They need to be multi-disciplinary. They need to be funded. And they need to have a plan.</p>
            <p>What began as Freya, David and Bertha eliminating frustrations in their work has turned into a monster that will reshape the very organisation they work within!</p>

            <p>Make no mistake. Establishing a design system is <em>hard</em>.</p>
            <p>Really. Fucking. <em>Hard</em>.</p>
            <p>Many organisations that now have effective design systems in place, only pulled them off after <em>years</em> of trying. Frequently they will have gone through several failed attempts before eventually succeeding.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Sharing the burden of work and the knowledge acquired from many, individual projects <em>should</em> be a no-brainer. But try calculating the dollar value of that. <em>That</em> is incredibly hard. Consequently, it can be a huge challenge to pursuade Billy the bean counter that setting up a design system will deliver a return on investment.</p>
            <p>To all the Berthas in the audience: Do <em>you</em> currently measure how much effort is spent across your entire organisation on UI-related work? Can you estimate what might be saved?</p>
            <p>What about Mark from marketing? If you're here Mark, are <em>you</em> able to estimate the monetary value of applying the brand more consistently across products?</p>
            <p>Ursula from UX, can <em>you</em> provide figures for how conversions might increase or user suport costs might drop, if the interface of your various products behaves more consistently?</p>
            <p>Gathering the facts and figures that help justify creating a design system <em>and keeping it alive</em> is something <em>you</em> can all contribute to!</p>

            <p>We've seen a lot of great tools emerge that can help the likes of Freya the front-end dev. Tools that make it easy to generate living style guides, update visual design templates, etc. ...when working with <em>web</em> technologies.</p>
            <p>What about Andy the Android developer though? If you build native apps for non-web platforms, the tooling situation is far less mature. Shouldn't there be native equivalents to Pattern Lab for Android, iOS and Windows? If you're an Andy, this is <em>your</em> chance to get stuck in and build one!</p>
            <p>How about non-visual UIs? Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant are user interfaces. You probably want your services on them to also provide consistent UI behaviour. Perhaps you also want your company's brand to be recognisable via them. Shouldn't your design system encompass that too? Make it the home for earcons, jingles and tone-of-voice guidelines. Sam the sound designer, if you're here, get involved!</p>
